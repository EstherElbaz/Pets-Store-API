# pets
website store
Sweet site for selling pets, but not only.

This code is suitable for anyone who wants to operate an online store on the Internet.
The emphasis in this project is the server side.
The project was written in the .net core framework, in c# and web-api.
The project presents work with the layer model and microservices.

Things unique to this project:
Using the entity framework.
Special attention to clean code.
Using a logger to monitor the program's performance.
Using DTO objects.
And many other good things.
The client side is developed in Java Script.

We will continue to write to you, good world.
Esther Elbaz.
